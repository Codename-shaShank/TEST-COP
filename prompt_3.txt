## Previous Attempts:
### Fix 1:
### FIX: test/integration/links_test.rb
```ruby
require "test_helper"

class LinksTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  test "cannot create link without url" do
    post links_path, params: { link: { url: "" } }
    assert_response :unprocessable_entity
  end
end
```

### FIX: app/controllers/links_controller.rb
```ruby
class LinksController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @link = Link.new(link_params)
    if @link.save
      redirect_to @link, notice: 'Link was successfully created.'
    else
      render :new, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end

  private

  def link_params
    params.require(:link).permit(:url)
  end
end
### Fix 2:
### FIX: app/models/link.rb
```ruby
class Link < ApplicationRecord
  validates :url, presence: true
end
```

### FIX: db/schema.rb
```ruby
ActiveRecord::Schema.define(version: 2023_10_27_000001) do

  create_table "links", force: :cascade do |t|
    t.string "url", null: false
    t.datetime "created_at", null: false
    t.datetime "updated_at", null: false
  end

end
```

### FIX: test/fixtures/links.yml
```yaml
one:
  url: "https://example.com"

two:
  url: "https://anotherexample.com"
```

### FIX: test/integration/links_test.rb

## Your Task (STRICT FORMAT):

You MUST respond only in this machine-readable format.

For EACH file you want to change, output:

### FIX: relative/path/to/file.ext
```LANG
# FULL NEW CONTENT OF THE FILE GOES HERE
# This must be the entire file, not a diff.
```

Rules:
- `relative/path/to/file.ext` is from the repo root (e.g. `app/assets/tailwind/application.css`).
- `LANG` is a language tag like ruby, yml, yaml, js, css, scss, etc.
- Include the COMPLETE file contents in the code block (no `...`).
- You may output multiple `### FIX:` blocks, one per file.
- If no code change is needed, output exactly:

NO_FIX_NEEDED

and nothing else.
