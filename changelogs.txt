### v4.0.0 / 2025-02-01
## v4.0.0 / 2025-02-01

### Upgrade to Tailwind CSS v4

General changes:

- The dependency on `tailwindcss-ruby` is set to `~> 4.0`.
- The location of (optional) `postcss.config.js` has moved from the `config/` directory to the app root.
- The input file `app/assets/tailwind/application.tailwind.css` has been renamed to `app/assets/tailwind/application.css`.
- If Propshaft is being used, `app/assets/tailwind` will be excluded from its asset handling.
- The Inter font is no longer packaged with the gem.
- Some Tailwind class names in the generated ERB templates are updated for v4.
- The README is updated to contain verbose instructions on upgrading.

Changes to the `tailwindcss:install` task:

- The `tailwindcss:install` task no longer installs `config/tailwind.config.js`, as v4 recommends placing Tailwind configuration in the CSS file.
- The Inter font is no longer configured in the application layout.
- The "tailwind" stylesheet link tag will only be added to the application layout if Propshaft isn't in use and therefore already handling `app/assets/build/tailwind.css`. Previously it was always injected, resulting in the tag being rendered twice if Propshaft was in use.

New task `tailwindcss:upgrade` upgrades many apps cleanly:

- Cleans up `config/tailwind.config.js` and references it from the CSS file as recommended for v4 upgrades.
- Runs the upstream upgrader (note: requires `npx` to run the one-time upgrade, but highly recommended).
- Removes configuration for the Inter font from the application layout.
- If present, moves `config/postcss.config.js` to the root directory.
- The "tailwind" stylesheet link tag will be removed if Propshaft is in use and already handling `app/assets/build/tailwind.css`.
- The input file `app/assets/tailwind/application.tailwind.css` will be moved to `app/assets/tailwind/application.css`.

Thanks to @EricGusmao, @patriciomacadden, @excid3, and @brunoprietog for their feedback, contributions, and advice on v4 support.

Changes to the `tailwindcss:install` task:

- The "tailwind" stylesheet link tag will only be added to the application layout if Propshaft isn't in use and already handling `app/assets/build/tailwind.css`. Previously it was always injected, resulting in the tag being rendered twice if Propshaft was in use.

### v4.0.0.rc1 / 2025-01-23
## v4.0.0.rc1 / 2025-01-23

### Upgrade to Tailwind CSS v4

General changes:

- Dependency on `tailwindcss-ruby` set to `~> 4.0`.
- The location of (optional) `postcss.config.js` has moved from the `config/` directory to the app root.

Changes to the `tailwindcss:install` task:

### v3.3.1 / 2025-01-23
## v3.3.1 / 2025-01-23

* Pin the dependency on `tailwindcss-ruby` to `~> 3.0` to prevent users from upgrading Tailwind to v4 while still on v3 of this gem.

  While it was useful during the Tailwind v4 beta period to allow users to float this dependency to try upgrading, we know (now that v4.0.0.rc1 of this gem is out) that not everything will work well if combining Tailwind v4 with `tailwindcss-rails` v3. Pinning this dependency should protect developers against unexpected issues.


### v3.3.0 / 2025-01-19
## v3.3.0 / 2025-01-19

* Add support for using the puma plugin in a standalone puma process (outside of `rails server`). (#458) @flavorjones


### v3.2.0 / 2025-01-10
## v3.2.0 / 2025-01-10

* Improve the scaffold views by making positions, padding, and sizes more consistent, add titles to all pages, add hover states and semantic colors to buttons and links, and change border and focus colors on fields with errors. (#452) @patriciomacadden

## v3.1.0 / 2024-12-29

### Notable changes

The tailwindcss plugins "form", "typography", and "container-queries" have been dropped from the default generated `tailwind.config.js` file. If you'd like to use them, you can re-add them to your project by uncommenting the appropriate lines in your config file. (#446) @flavorjones




### v3.0.0 / 2024-10-15
## v3.0.0

### Notable changes
