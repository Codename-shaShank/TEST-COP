class CreateLinksDuplicateCleanup < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.1]
  def change
    # This file was added to avoid collision with another migration file.
    # The original migration logic is now in the correct migration file:
    # db/migrate/20231010000000_create_links.rb
    # This file is kept as a placeholder to maintain sequential consistency
    # in case the previous duplicate is encountered.
