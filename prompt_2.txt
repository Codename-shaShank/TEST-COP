Tasks: TOP => test:prepare => tailwindcss:build
(See full trace by running task with --trace)

## Previous Fix Attempt:
### ANALYSIS:
The failure occurred because Tailwind CSS (`tailwindcss-rails`) requires changes in the input CSS file structure after the version upgrade. The `application.css` file referenced in the error message `./app/assets/tailwind/application.css` does not exist, which is expected by the new Tailwind CSS build configuration. 

Additionally, `sqlite3` has been upgraded significantly (from `1.7.3` to `2.9.0`). Rails 8 requires `sqlite3 >= 2.1`, which uses the `sqlite3` gem for new APIs, leading to potential issues if the Rails application hasn’t adapted to these changes.

### FIX 1: `app/assets/stylesheets/application.tailwind.css`
Create a Tailwind configuration file in the `app/assets/stylesheets/` folder as follows:

```css
/* app/assets/stylesheets/application.tailwind.css */

/* Tailwind directives */
@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
```

### FIX 2: `config/initializers/assets.rb`
Ensure the new Tailwind entry in the assets manifest is specified. Update the `assets.rb` file as below:

```ruby
# config/initializers/assets.rb

# Add application.tailwind.css to the asset precompile path
Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w[application.tailwind.css]
```

### FIX 3: Configure Tailwind Config
Run this command to regenerate the missing `tailwind.config.js` file and ensure that Tailwind CSS can process the input file:
```sh
rails tailwindcss:install
```

Afterward, confirm that `tailwind.config.js` exists in your project root.

### FIX 4: Adjust Deprecated `sqlite3` API (if errors occur)
If application tests or scripts fail after upgrading to `sqlite3 >= 2.1`, it's often due to deprecations in SQLite's new API (`2.x` uses `Database.new` instead of `SQLite3::Database.open`).

For example, update any SQLite-related code like:

#### OLD:
```ruby
db = SQLite3::Database.open("db/development.sqlite3")
