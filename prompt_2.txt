## Previous Fix Attempt:
### FIX: app/assets/tailwind/application.css
```css
/*
  This is the Tailwind CSS entry file for the application.
*/

/* Add your Tailwind imports and custom CSS here */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* Additional styles (if any) can go here */
```

### FIX: config/application.rb
```ruby
require_relative "boot"

require "rails/all"

# Require the gems listed in Gemfile, including any gems
# you've limited to :test, :development, or :production.
Bundler.require(*Rails.groups)

module TestCop
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # Initialize configuration defaults for originally generated Rails version.
    config.load_defaults 8.1

    # Configuration for the application, engines, and railties goes here.
    # These settings can be overridden in specific environments using the files
    # in config/environments, which are processed later.

    # Add this to ensure TailwindCSS works with sprockets
    config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join("app", "assets", "stylesheets")
    config.assets.precompile += %w( application.css )
  end
end
```

This should resolve the issue with the missing `app/assets/tailwind/application.css` file and properly include Tailwind CSS in the asset pipeline.

## Your Task (STRICT FORMAT):

You MUST respond only in this machine-readable format.

For EACH file you want to change, output:

### FIX: relative/path/to/file.ext
```LANG
# FULL NEW CONTENT OF THE FILE GOES HERE
# This must be the entire file, not a diff.
```

Rules:
- `relative/path/to/file.ext` is from the repo root (e.g. `app/assets/tailwind/application.css`).
- `LANG` is a language tag like ruby, yml, yaml, js, css, scss, etc.
- Include the COMPLETE file contents in the code block (no `...`).
- You may output multiple `### FIX:` blocks, one per file.
- If no code change is needed, output exactly:

NO_FIX_NEEDED

and nothing else.
