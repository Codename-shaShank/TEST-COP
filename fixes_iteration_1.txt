### FIX: app/assets/tailwind/application.css
```css
/*
  This is the Tailwind CSS entry file for the application.
*/

/* Add your Tailwind imports and custom CSS here */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* Additional styles (if any) can go here */
```

### FIX: config/application.rb
```ruby
require_relative "boot"

require "rails/all"

# Require the gems listed in Gemfile, including any gems
# you've limited to :test, :development, or :production.
Bundler.require(*Rails.groups)

module TestCop
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # Initialize configuration defaults for originally generated Rails version.
    config.load_defaults 8.1

    # Configuration for the application, engines, and railties goes here.
    # These settings can be overridden in specific environments using the files
    # in config/environments, which are processed later.

    # Add this to ensure TailwindCSS works with sprockets
    config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join("app", "assets", "stylesheets")
    config.assets.precompile += %w( application.css )
  end
end
```

This should resolve the issue with the missing `app/assets/tailwind/application.css` file and properly include Tailwind CSS in the asset pipeline.
