## Source Files (relevant to failures):

 ## Your Task (STRICT FORMAT):

 You MUST respond only in this machine-readable format.

 For EACH file you want to change, output:

 ### FIX: relative/path/to/file.ext
 ```LANG
 # FULL NEW CONTENT OF THE FILE GOES HERE
 # This must be the entire file, not a diff.
 ```

 Rules:
 - `relative/path/to/file.ext` is from the repo root (e.g. `app/assets/tailwind/application.css`).
 - `LANG` is a language tag like ruby, yml, yaml, js, css, scss, etc.
 - Include the COMPLETE file contents in the code block (no `...`).
 - You may output multiple `### FIX:` blocks, one per file.
 - If no code change is needed, output exactly:

 NO_FIX_NEEDED

 and nothing else.
